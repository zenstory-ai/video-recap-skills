"""Cross-platform test runner: one isolated pytest process per skill group.

Each skill ships its OWN lib.py (the bundle has no shared code), so a single
`pytest tests/` would import several skills' modules into one process and collide
on the `lib` module name. Run one group per subprocess instead.

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (the bash equivalent is scripts/test.sh).

Usage: python scripts/test.py            # run every skill group
       python scripts/test.py script     # run one or more named groups
