"""Regression tests for the P2 visual-substrate changes.

Q9: per-scene VLM frame sampling scales with scene length (~1 frame / vlm_seconds_per_frame,
floor 3, capped by vlm_max_frames) instead of the old hard cap of 6 that starved long scenes.

W3: the MiMo video-overview becomes the PRIMARY per-scene description when present; the frame
VLM still supplies frame_facts (so the substrate grade cannot regress) and the original frame
description is kept under frame_description as the fallback.
